## Wireframes

I used the website wireframes.cc to create my wireframes.

## Issues during site development

### Player images and positioning their divs

I used divs for the player images and used the command display: inline in order to display the images horizontally across the screen. Following this centring the elements could only be achieved by adding by adding in margin-left values. This worked on the primary desktop screen but was not responsive upon testing on other screen sizes. To combat the problem, an unordered list with the player images was used. this allowed for the use of text: align to centre the images on all devices 

### Statistic pages for individual players was not user friendly

After completing the unordered list for the squad, individual statistic pages were added for each player. Clicking on each player and then returning to team page was very time consuming and with a reality large squad did not provide an adequate user experience. Therefore, a flip card effect was implemented revealing the player stats once the mouse is hovered over a chosen player. 

### Player images and positioning their divs – take 2

In order to implement the flip card effect the original divs were reverted back to as opposed to an unordered list. re-emerging the initial problem of centring the flip card divs. Further research provided the flexbox method. Using the code display: flex, flex-direction: row, flex-wrap: wrap and justify-content: center, achieved the desired layout. This approach was responsive on all screen sizes.

### League table became squashed on mobile and other smaller devices

An issue arose with the structure of the league table on smaller devices. As the screen size became smaller the text began to become squashed with some team names requiring 3 lines. This was solved by implementing a scroll function for the smaller screen sizes.

## Validator Testing

•	HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

•	CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator


## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub.Pages. The project was developed using Gitpod where the git version control system was used to commit all changes. The changes were then saved to Github using the push command.
